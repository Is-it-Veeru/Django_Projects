      <h3>Math - Calculus Introduction</h3>
      <p>Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the concepts of change and motion. It provides tools and methods for studying how quantities change with respect to one another. Calculus is a fundamental field of mathematics and is widely used in science, engineering, economics, and many other areas. It is primarily divided into two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus.</p>

      <h4>Differential Calculus:</h4>
      <p>  Derivatives: Differential calculus focuses on the concept of derivatives, which measure the rate of change of a function. In simple terms, a derivative tells you how a function's output (dependent variable) changes as its input (independent variable) changes. The derivative of a function is often denoted as f'(x) or dy/dx.
      </p>
      <p>Limits: The concept of limits is fundamental to calculus. The derivative is defined as the limit of the average rate of change as the change in the independent variable approaches zero.</p>
      <h4>Integral Calculus:</h4>
      <p>Integrals: Integral calculus deals with the concept of integrals, which are used to find the accumulation or total of quantities over an interval. Integrals can be thought of as calculating the area under a curve. The integral of a function is often denoted as âˆ« f(x) dx.
      </p>
      <p>Definite and Indefinite Integrals: Integrals can be classified as definite and indefinite. The indefinite integral, or antiderivative, represents a family of functions whose derivative is the original function. A definite integral calculates the net accumulation of a quantity over a specific interval.</p><br><br>
